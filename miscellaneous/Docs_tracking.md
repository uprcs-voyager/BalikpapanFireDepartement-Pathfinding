# Timeline of the projects
## Algorithm used
The algorithm used for this pathfinding project is A*
- G Cost = Distance from the starting node
- H Cost (heuristic) = Distance from end node 
- F Cost = G Cost + F cost  
## Preparing the data
- getting the balikpapan map using osmnx
- Downloading the balikpapan graphml to speed up runtime by being getting the graphml data locally 
- Inspecting available data for the nodes and edges
